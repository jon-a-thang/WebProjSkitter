# Jonathan Jang & Benajamin Greeman

1.) What Web Application Security mechanisms are involved in your topology? What security mechanisms would ideally be involved?
	In our topology, SAML is used to authenticate users. Ideally, the site would also have an SSL certificate to ensure privacy.
2.) What testing framework did you choose and why?
	We have chosen Locust because Python is easier to work with than Java.
