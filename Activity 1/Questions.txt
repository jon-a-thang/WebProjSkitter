# Activity 1 Questions
# Jonathan Jang & Benajamin Greeman

1.) What is the URL of your Github project?
	https://github.com/jwj3767/WebProjSkitter
2.) How did you breakup your projects and what are the security ramifications?
	We decided to map out what the minimum requirements were for each step and map out the required work.
	I do not see any security ramifications of doing this.
3.) How did you choose to break down your milestones into various issues (tasks)?
	We looked over the steps that were required and arbitrarily chose who would work on which steps.
4.) How do you ensure that after each issue/milestone that security has been verified? How would you identify such issues in an ideal environment?
	Running tests on Travis CI is likely the best solution. We could use it to attempt to breach the website, or we could try
	to mine passwords.
